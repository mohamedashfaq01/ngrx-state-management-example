## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The primary goal of this project is to understand and demonstrate state management in Angular using the NgRx library. It showcases how to manage shared state—like a shopping cart—efficiently using actions, reducers, selectors, and the store. The Cart Summary page and other components can be further enhanced, as illustrated in the screenshot below.
